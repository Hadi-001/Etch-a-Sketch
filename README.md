# Etch-A-Sketch Web Project

This is a web-based Etch-A-Sketch drawing application that allows users to draw on a grid using various tools like a pencil, eraser, color picker, and a rainbow mode. The grid can be dynamically resized, and users can choose from a color palette or pick colors directly from the grid. The project also includes a reset function to clear the drawing board.

- **Color Picker Tool**: Choose colors either from a palette or by clicking on a color within the grid.

- **Reset Button**: Clears the grid and allows for a fresh start.
